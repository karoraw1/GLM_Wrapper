    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microbial Metabolism and Meteorological Process\n",
    "\n",
    "I am interested in how meteorological, seasonal, and physical processes affect microbial metabolism within a lake. A biogeochemical model developed by Hunter at al. <a name=\"ref-1\"/>[(1998)](#cite-Hunter199853) and modified by Prehiem et al. <a name=\"ref-2\"/>[(2016)](#cite-Preheim2016) was implemented to predict the metabolic redox reactions based on initial values measured at 1 $m$ meter depth intervals for Upper Mystic Lake in Winchester, MA. The model uses theoretical energetic yields based on redox potentials to determine the order in which nutrients become depleted. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Mystic Lakes are located at 42.4317° N, 71.1483° W, within the boundaries Winchester, Arlington, and Medford, MA. They both lie 1 $m$ above sea level. The Aberjona River feeds into Upper Mystic Lake, which flows over the Mystic dam into Lower Mystic Lake, which drains out through the Mystic River. Mystic River splits within 100m of the lake and a portion goes off into Alewife Creek, while the rest flows out into Boston Harbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Mystic Lakes are dimictic, and therefore both show strong seasonal stratification that progresses throughout the year. In nature, it is assumed that the most of microbial metabolism is fueled by reduction of molecular oxygen for the oxidation of organic carbon. The source of this organic carbon is \"particulate biomass, humics from rainwater runoff, and photosynthesis\" <a name=\"ref-3\"/>[(Preheim et al, 2016)](#cite-Preheim2016). The source of the oxygen is also photosynthesis, as well as diffusion out of the atmosphere, both of which happen just beneath the surface in the hypolimnion. As these two chemical species strongly influence the magnitude and rate of microbial metabolism throughout the water column, I would like to investigate the meterological varaibles which modify their distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, it uses an empirically accurate methods for modelling vertical transport and mixing. However, the General Lake Model <a name=\"ref-4\"/>[(Read et al, 2014)](#cite-Read2014142) is another similar tool which is better grounded in theory and incorporates meteorological data into determinations of vertical transport. The GLM user manual describes itself as \"ideally suited to long-term investigations ranging from months to decades, and for coupling with biogeochemical models to explore the role that stratification and vertical mixing play on lake ecosystem dynamics.\" It is my ultimate objective to perform a sensitivity analysis on the GLM to determine the relative contributions wind, sun, cloud cover, and precipitation on biogeochemistry within the lake.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent variables I would like to evaluate include air temperature, inflow salinity, runoff volume, solar radiation, wind fetch, precipitation, and cloud cover. Each of these variables contribute in varying proportions to the degree of heat flux throughout the water column, and thus control vertical mixing. I have a poor understanding of the relative contributions of each factor, as well as the secondary effects that they control. For example, the duration of sunlight will contribute heat directly to the lake surface, however it will also increase phytoplankton-based turbidity and promote evaporation, which have the opposite effect. The appropriate way of dealing with this is to perform a sort of factor screening experiment <a name=\"ref-5\"/>[(Montgomery, 2000)](#cite-Montgomery2000), in which variables are modified either one at a time, and in combinations, and their individual or interaction effects are observed. The inputs to and the outputs from the model are time series of measurements. Artifical time series will be created such that a baseline condition can be established. The baseline or control conditions will be devised such that they most closely resemble the conditions at Mystic Lake at the appropriate time of year. Data from nearby streams are substituted based on the resemblance of any other available data common between the two locations. A minimum run time of 1 year for each instance of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a baseline is established, real datasets will be introduced for each varaible. Simulation duration will be limited to minimum of two years. This would provide me with a good intuition into the relative contributions of each input into lake mixing. By calculating the effect of each input dataset on particular output variables below \n",
    "\n",
    "I am interested in seeing how much each variable changes the time series produced for *Lake Number*, *total*, *evaporated*, and *rainfall volumes*, *lake surface area*, *benthic light value*, *average significant wave height*, as well as the *temperatures* at each depth. These 8 parameters were selected from the 27 available options because most are likely indicators of a mixing and a subsequent compositional change within the lake. In particular, significant changes in Lake Number during the Winter season would indicate that deep mixing is occuring and dissolved oxygen is being delivered to the lake bed <a name=\"ref-6\"/>[(Robertson & Imberger, 1994)](#cite-Jorg1994). I would also like to know how much volume runoff contributes into a lake, and the required minimum concentration of water-quality nutrients necessary to significantly modify the fluxes of species considered in the model. If either parameter had a significant impact, it would indicate that integration of biogeochemical models with physical & meteorological models is a necessary marriage in order to adequately characterize microbial metabolism in dimictic lakes (at least).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements to run the GLM include a hypsographic curve to describe the storage, elevation, and area relationships. Depth contours shown here were found in a document produced by the State Division of Fisheries and Wildlife by searching the Mass.gov site. The same map was used by Fricker & Nepf [](cite-#JGRC8090) in their study on seiches in Upper Mystic Lake.\n",

    "`.hdf` files are images. `.nc` files are provided by CERES and produced by GLM. These must be imported by Python. Once imported, all data sets require aggregation to a uniform daily frequency, filtering/replacement of NaNs, and subdivision into a uniform time domain. \n",

    "- (Mystic River Water Temp, Hobbs Brook Water Temp)\n",
    "- (Aberjona Precipitation, GHCN Precipitation)\n",
    "\n",
    "** Milestone 4**: Optimize Lake Specific Model Parameters<br>\n",
    "The following initial conditions may also be modified as they are \"lake specific\": *Stream-bed drag*, *seepage rate*, *critical area*, and the *extinction coefficient* for PAR radiation. The criticial area is \"critical area below which wind sheltering may occur.\" I am not sure how to calculate appropriate values for these, so testing the effect of deviations from their defaults may prove interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Milestone 5**: Run model with baseline and experimental conditions <br>\n",
    "Write script to automate iterative evaluations of `GLM` with each combination of input conditions, record dependent variables, and, once complete, test results for statistical significance. \n",
